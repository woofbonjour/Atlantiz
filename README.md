Topic Ideas
- Solutions to ground water depletion early
- Trackign water flow patterns to collect pollution
- Errosion Mitigation prediction and alerting system


over time
river levles
rainfall
explainable AI
heat maps
soil errosion
rainfall at x can cause landslide at y
reasonable dpeendancies
space and time based dependancies
LSDMS transformers
combining datasets
what do we want to predict? what would be needed for explainations
  eg daily input stream of pics because soil erosion is detencted overtime
  logistics of settign up cameras?
  preliminary


SCORED ON
inspiration - main idea
technology - code quality and demonstrations and descriptions
design and innovation - website hpw it looks, interactivity (front end)
presentation - common skills and ability to clearly define problem, address it and discuss ideas


"Google Earth Engine - Timelapse" collaberate with NASA over years for public database
eg NZ focus on coromandel more proned to landslides, flooding and other issues
timelapse data currently from 1984 - 2022
can see real time changes
can be used as alerting system for emergency services and locals for safety predictions


- website
  displayed embedded location
- AI
  data 2010-2022 eg 8 years trainign and 4 years prediction 
- presentation slide


stream of images each day
training AI eg 15 years total data: train on 10 and predict followign 5. sanity check.

current website - embed location for demo
identify areas of high risk to apply this
  eg coramandle, auckland, bay of plenty, wellington

could also be applied to non-visible areas eg light absorbtion/reflection graphs to detect plants, soil typpes, sink holes, etc.
Same idea applied for different erosion area
